ThirdFrame is a web app, similar to Instagram, where users can post and comment on their pictures.

Unlike the other web apps, I built ThirdFrame using the test driven development approach. I implemented tests to validate posts, pictures, and comments. With the use of FactoryGirl, I ran tests with dryer code.
